Priority scheduling (Non-Preemptive) algorithm

The project's aim is to implement the Priority scheduling (Non-Preemptive) algorithm "A CPU scheduling algorithm"
Priority scheduling is one of the most common scheduling algorithms used by the operating system to schedule processes based on their priority.
Each process is assigned a priority. The process with the highest priority is to be executed first and so on.

Processes with the same priority are executed on a first-come first served basis. Priority can be decided based on memory requirements, time requirements or any other resource requirement. Also priority can be decided on the ratio of average I/O to average CPU burst time.

Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling
In Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling, the CPU is not taken away from the running process. Even if a higher-priority process arrives, the currently running process will complete first.

Ex: A high-priority process must wait until the currently running process finishes

This project also includes a GUI to test and simulate the algorithm in a user friendly way


For the ability of working with arrays with ease, we found Python to be our preferred programming language to use in this project.
As we had decided to use Python, using Tkinter was our choice for creating the GUI for this project


To run this project you should have Python installed on your machine as well as your preferred IDE, after that, you can downloading the project file and use it in your IDE and it should run totallt fine.
